#Disc Golf Weather

[See Live](https://drzoid14.github.io/Frolf-Weather/)

After moving multiple times in a short number of years, I decided to develop this app that will show you the closest disc golf courses and weather for that area

Search Results

If you decide not to share your location, you can use the search bar to find courses near you - or find courses further away if you are planning a trip!

## API Documentation
This app uses the [FourSquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/) to get information for the disc golf courses, the [weahterbit API](https://developer.foursquare.com/) to get weather information for the area, and the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/) to map out the location of the nearby courses

## Tech Used
This app is a Front End only built using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery
